\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Sardine is a next generation WebDAV client for Java.
    It is intended to be simple to use and does not implement the full WebDAV client specification (although a good amount is covered).
    Instead, the goal is to provide methods for most use case scenarios when working with a webdav server.
