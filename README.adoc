## OSGi wrapper for Sardine 5.7

Sardine is a next generation WebDAV client for Java. It is intended to be simple to use and does not implement the full WebDAV client specification (although a good amount is covered). Instead, the goal is to provide methods for most use case scenarios when working with a webdav server.
